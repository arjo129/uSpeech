/* fix_fft.c - Fixed-point in-place Fast Fourier Transform  */
/*
 All data are fixed-point short integers, in which -32768
 to +32768 represent -1.0 to +1.0 respectively. Integer
 arithmetic is used for speed, instead of the more natural
 floating-point.
 
 For the forward FFT (time -> freq), fixed scaling is
 performed to prevent arithmetic overflow, and to map a 0dB
 sine/cosine wave (i.e. amplitude = 32767) to two -6dB freq
 coefficients. The return value is always 0.
 
 For the inverse FFT (freq -> time), fixed scaling cannot be
 done, as two 0dB coefficients would sum to a peak amplitude
 of 64K, overflowing the 32k range of the fixed-point integers.
 Thus, the fix_fft() routine performs variable scaling, and
 returns a value which is the number of bits LEFT by which
 the output must be shifted to get the actual amplitude
 (i.e. if fix_fft() returns 3, each value of fr[] and fi[]
 must be multiplied by 8 (2**3) for proper scaling.
 Clearly, this cannot be done within fixed-point short
 integers. In practice, if the result is to be used as a
 filter, the scale_shift can usually be ignored, as the
 result will be approximately correctly normalized as is.

 Real FFT/iFFT using half-size complex FFT by distributing
 even/odd samples into real/imaginary arrays respectively.
 In order to save data space (i.e. to avoid two arrays, one
 for real, one for imaginary samples), we proceed in the
 following two steps: a) samples are rearranged in the real
 array so that all even samples are in places 0-(N/2-1) and
 all imaginary samples in places (N/2)-(N-1), and b) fix_fft
 is called with fr and fi pointing to index 0 and index N/2
 respectively in the original array. The above guarantees
 that fix_fft "sees" consecutive real samples as alternating
